	<h4 class="tk-proxima-nova">1.	Introduction</h4>

	<p class="tk-proxima-nova">This Privacy Policy sets forth the privacy practices of TutorScoop and its affiliates (collectively, "GuideU") with respect to all information, data, graphics, content, software applications, including the GuideU App (the "App"); the GuideU website (the "Site"); and other GuideU services provided or otherwise made accessible on or through the App or the Site.  Collectively, the Site, the App and the other GuideU services are hereinafter referred to as the "Services".  In this Privacy Policy, "we", "us", "our" and other similar references mean GuideU and "you" and "your" and other similar references mean a specific user of the Services.</p>

	<p class="tk-proxima-nova">We understand and respect the privacy concerns of our users, and we have made it a critical focus of the Services to protect the confidentiality and security of the personal information you provide us.  We have created this Privacy Policy to inform you about how we collect, use and share your personal information, and our privacy practices.</p>

	<p class="tk-proxima-nova">

	<h4 class="tk-proxima-nova">2.	The Information We Collect</h4>

	<p class="tk-proxima-nova">We may collect two types of information:  Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") and Non-Personally Identifiable Information ("Non-PII").</p>

	<p class="tk-proxima-nova">PII is information that identifies a specific user of the Services.  When you engage in certain activities on the Services, such as when you register to use the Services, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself that we will collect and store, such as your first and last name, gender, email address, ZIP code, year of birth, and email address.  PII may also include location-specific information, such as GPS data generated by your mobile device.  Depending on what activity you are engaged in, some of the information that we request will be identified as mandatory.  If you do not provide the mandatory information for a particular activity that requires it, you will not be permitted to engage in that activity.</p>

	<p class="tk-proxima-nova">We may also collect PII from third party apps and websites, including Facebook and Twitter, when you access our services through one of these third parties, or when you access the Services using your credentials from such third party sites or apps.  If you do so, the information we collect may be limited by the third party’s own privacy policies. If you visit or use any such website or app, we encourage you to review that website or app’s  privacy policy.  We are not responsible for the policies or practices of third parties.</p>

	<p class="tk-proxima-nova">Non-PII is information that identifies your computer or mobile device and its navigational patterns through the Services (but does not identify a specific user).  We may automatically collect Non-PII information when you visit the Services, through the use of a variety of tools including cookies (small text files that are stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes and which contain information about that user’s computer), or other available data analysis or collection technologies.</p>

	<h4 class="tk-proxima-nova">3.	How We Use and Share Information</h4>

	<p class="tk-proxima-nova">We may use the information we collect to (a) provide the Services you request, including location-based services, that rely on, use or incorporate the location of a device to provide or enhance the Service; (b) notify you of promotions, special events, new Services and special offers; (c) improve our product offerings, customer service and overall user experience; (d) improve the content, operation, appearance and utility of the Services; (e) conduct surveys, research and evaluations; (f) troubleshoot and resolve disputes; (g) gather demographic data; and (h) accomplish other administrative tasks.</p>

	<p class="tk-proxima-nova">We may permit users to link their Facebook and Twitter accounts to the Services, so that users can post their recent activity on our Services to their accounts on those third party services and otherwise coordinate the Services with such other accounts.</p>

	<p class="tk-proxima-nova">We may share your information collected on the Services with our subsidiaries and other affiliated companies, and with other vendors and business partners, including marketing partners, with whom we work (collectively, "Our Affiliates").  Such business partners include companies who provide business services to us or on our behalf such as to market products or services to you, monitor Services activity, serve Services content, help to maintain our customer database, and administer e-mails, surveys or other contests.  We also reserve the right to disclose your information in good faith as required by law, in response to legal process including law enforcement requests; with any person or entity that has acquired all or any part of our business or assets; and where needed to prevent fraud and to protect the safety, property, or legal rights of users of the Services or Our Affiliates.</p>

	<h4 class="tk-proxima-nova">Unsubscribe or Opt Out</h4>

	<p class="tk-proxima-nova">If you decide that you are no longer interested in receiving recommendations or communications from us, you may follow the instructions in our emails to unsubscribe from our email list or send an email to support@GuideU.co</p>


	<h4 class="tk-proxima-nova">5.	Editing and Deleting Your Information</h4>

	<p class="tk-proxima-nova">You may revoke consent at any time for any use of PII, including user location information, collected from you under this Privacy Policy.  To revoke consent and re-set your privacy settings, indicate by checking the "I revoke" box at the end of this Privacy Policy.  Even after you revoke consent or remove your information from your profile, copies of your information may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent it has been shared with others or it was copied or stored by other users.  We may also be required to retain your information by law or for legitimate business purposes, such as to prevent identity theft or other misconduct.</p>

	<p class="tk-proxima-nova">You may request a copy of your PII, or correct factual inaccuracies it may contain, by contacting our privacy manager at support@GuideU.co</p>

	 <h4 class="tk-proxima-nova">6.	Storage and Security</h4>

	<p class="tk-proxima-nova">We believe the security of your information is a serious issue and we are committed to protecting the information we receive from you.  We use commercially reasonable security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of your information under our control.  Notwithstanding such measures, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted to or from the Services.  We also are not responsible for the actions of any third parties that may receive any such information.</p>

	<p class="tk-proxima-nova">We may transfer your information to, or maintain it on, computers located outside of your state or country, in a location having laws that are less protective of your privacy. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, be advised that GuideU is located in the United States and processes your information in the United States.  By using the Services under this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use, you consent to the transfer of your information to the United States.</p>

	<p class="tk-proxima-nova">We will retain PII only as long as our business needs require.  We will then destroy or render unreadable any such information upon disposal.</p>

	<h4 class="tk-proxima-nova">7.	User Age and Privacy</h4>

	<p class="tk-proxima-nova">We do not collect or maintain information from anyone known by us to be under the age of 13, and no part of the Services is designed to attract anyone under the age of 18.  Users under the age of 18 may only use the Services under the supervision and direction of a parent or legal guardian.  Such parent or legal guardian covenants and agrees to cause said minor to adhere to all of the provisions of this Privacy Policy and shall indemnify GuideU and our respective successors and assigns, from and against any and all liability arising out of the use by said minor under his or her supervision and direction.</p>

	<h4 class="tk-proxima-nova">8.	Changes to Privacy Policy</h4>

	<p class="tk-proxima-nova">We may change this Privacy Policy at any time.  The revised Privacy Policy will be effective immediately when posted on the Services.  It is the responsibility of each user to review the Services and the Privacy Policy periodically to learn of any revisions to this Privacy Policy.  Your continued use of the Services after such revisions take effect will constitute your acknowledgment and acceptance of the terms of the revised Privacy Policy, provided that it does not authorize the use of your PII for a new or materially different purpose.</p>
